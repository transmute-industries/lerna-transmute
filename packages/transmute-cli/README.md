# Transmute CLI

A command line tool for managing transmute services in minikube, as soon azure, and google. This will assist in the provisioning and initialization of the cluster, and other maintenance tasks.

- [Docs](https://docs.transmute.industries/transmute-cli/1.0.0/)


```
npm i
npm run build
npm run transmute
npm run transmute help
```


### login

`transmute login`

This will use PKCE to login with okta. A JWT will be stored here:

`~/.transmute/cli-secrets/session.json`

This is for use with the centralized transmute API.


### telemetry

`transmute telemetry <on|off>`

This will turn on or off telemetry sending to mixpanel.

To override the mixpanel project id, you can set the env variable `MIXPANEL_PROJECT_ID`.
