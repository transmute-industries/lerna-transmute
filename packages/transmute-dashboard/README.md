# Transmute Dashboard

This react dashboard provides a reference implementation for the transmute framework, and some centralized directory support for the transmute platform.

It is WIP, and subject to change.

Currently, we are establishing an idenitity flow that is compatible with PGP, Ethereum and centralized directories, such as Auth0 and Okta.


```
lerna bootstrap
npm run truffle:migrate
npm run start
```

### Testing With Transmute CLI

The transmute CLI helps manage a local minikube environment which is more similar to production environments such as GKE, Azure, or AWS.

In order to develop against services hosted in this environment, some changes are necessary:

Migrate contracts to ganache hosted in minikube:

```
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED='0' TRANSMUTE_ENV='minikube' npm run truffle:migrate   
```

Edit `./src/transmute-config/index.js` - set `transmute.network` to `minikube`

### Deployment

This is for contributors only.

`git submodule add https://github.com/transmute-industries/dashboard.transmute.network.git production`

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
